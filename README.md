# 💵 Vangtichai

An Android app built as one of my first practice projects in an Android development course. This app calculates the minimum number of currency notes needed to make up a given amount while ensuring data persistence on screen rotation using **ViewModel**. 🚀

---

## ✨ Features

- 🔢 **Input Any Amount** – Enter a number, and the app breaks it down into the least number of notes.
- 💾 **State Persistence** – Values remain even when the screen is rotated, thanks to ViewModel.
- 🎨 **Simple & Clean UI** – Easy-to-use interface for quick calculations.
- 🚀 **Lightweight & Fast** – Works efficiently without unnecessary overhead.

---

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- **Kotlin** – For Android development.
- **ViewModel** – To retain data across configuration changes.
